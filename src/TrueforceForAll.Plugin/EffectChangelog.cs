// Catalog of effects + per-version changelog entries that drive the
// "what's new" banner and the per-effect NEW badges.
//
// Two ideas live here:
//   - KnownEffectIds is the source of truth for what's shippable today.
//     On fresh install (or first run on a pre-feature settings file) the
//     plugin pre-marks every one as already seen, so existing users don't
//     get a wall of badges for effects they've already been tuning.
//   - Versions is an append-only, chronologically-ordered list. The banner
//     shows everything strictly newer than the user's LastSeenVersion;
//     dismissing stamps LastSeenVersion to the running build so the same
//     entries don't pop up twice.
//
// To ship a new effect:
//   1. Add its stable ID string to KnownEffectIds.
//   2. Add a ChangelogVersion to the tail of Versions with one ChangelogEntry
//      per user-visible thing (EffectId = the same string for items that
//      should also trigger a per-section "NEW" badge).
