// Airborne ducking coordinator. Unlike every other entry in the effects list
// this voice produces NO audio of its own: RenderAdd is a no-op. Its job is to
// detect when the car is off the ground (via TelemetryFrame.Airborne, set by
// the enhanced sources that can tell, AC and Forza) and tell the plugin's
// ducker to pull down the OTHER effects, so a jump or a crest pop doesn't fire
// a phantom slide, engine roar, or road rumble while the wheels free-spin in
// the air.
//
// Policy lives here (which voices to duck, and by how much); the actual
// per-tick multiplier application lives in TrueforcePlugin.UpdateDucking,
// which reads AirborneActive + the toggles and folds an airborne factor into
// each target's DuckMultiplier on top of the sidechain ducking. The two
// compose multiplicatively, so airborne ducking and sidechain ducking stack
// cleanly.
//
// Detection requires a source that surfaces wheel load / suspension travel, so
// this only engages in AC and Forza today. On the universal SimHub fallback
// TelemetryFrame.Airborne is null and AirborneActive stays false (a no-op),
// the same way the stationary spring no-ops where steering isn't reported.
