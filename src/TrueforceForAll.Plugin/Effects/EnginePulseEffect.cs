// The signature Trueforce sensation: a periodic pulse at the engine's firing
// frequency. Scales amplitude with RPM relative to the redline so idle is a
// gentle hum and pulling toward redline gives meaningful kick.
//
// Synthesis runs at the engine cycle rate (RPM/120 × pitch). One synth cycle
// = one full 720° crank rotation, and within that cycle we lay down N pulses
// at the configured pattern's positions, weighted by per-pulse amplitudes.
// The cycle waveform is precomputed into a 2048-sample buffer at pattern-
// change time (a "wavetable" purely as an implementation detail) and walked
// at the cycle frequency. For even-fire patterns the output is a smooth
// periodic waveform at firing freq; for non-uniform patterns it produces the
// characterful timbre (cross-plane V8 lope, Ducati L-twin gap, etc.).
