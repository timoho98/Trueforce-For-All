// SimHub plugin owning the Trueforce HID session and the audio-haptic Mixer.
//
// Lifecycle:
//   Init: load settings → discover wheel → open + init + start stream →
//         create AudioCaptureSource (per-process loopback, retargeted on
//         game start/stop) and add it to the Mixer.
//   DataUpdate: track current game name / process for the capture timer.
//   End: save settings, stop producer + capture, clean up the device.
//
// The producer thread runs independently of the SimHub data tick because
// Trueforce wants 1 kHz samples; SimHub's data ticks vary by game (60-200 Hz
// typical) and would be too coarse to drive the stream directly.
