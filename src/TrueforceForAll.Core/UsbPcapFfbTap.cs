// 0x8123 (G-series force feedback) function 2 long-form messages, signed
// 16-bit big-endian at offset 10-11 of the HID++ payload. The firmware-
// assigned feature *index* varies per wheel (0x0e on G PRO); it is seeded
// to 0x0e and auto-resolved per wheel (see _ffbFeatureIndex). When we
// stream Trueforce on ep3, the wheel uses
// bytes 6-9 of our packet as motor torque, ignoring AC's ep0 commands. By
// mirroring AC's commands into bytes 6-9, FFB and Trueforce coexist.

// USBPcap installs as a kernel-mode USB filter driver. USBPcapCMD.exe streams
// pcap to stdout when invoked with -o -. We don't require admin in our
