// Telemetry source abstraction. Effects consume TelemetryFrame instead of
// SimHub's GameData so we can swap in a higher-rate source (game native
// shared memory, UDP, etc.) without touching effect code.
//
// The default fallback is SimHubTelemetrySource (lives in the Plugin
// assembly because it depends on GameReaderCommon). Per-game enhanced
// sources live alongside it and are selected by the plugin on game change.
//
// Threading: OnFrame fires on whichever thread the source polls on
// (SimHub's data tick for the SimHub source, a dedicated MMF thread for
// AC, etc.). Effects already tolerate cross-thread state mutation
// primitive double/float reads/writes are atomic on 64-bit .NET and the
// producer thread reads those fields with eventual-consistency semantics.
